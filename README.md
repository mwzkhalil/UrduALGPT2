# UrduALGPT2
This repository implements an approach that combines ALBERT (A Lite BERT) with the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture for natural language processing tasks. The project consists of two main files: `train.py` and `model.py`.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the strengths of both ALBERT and GPT in natural language understanding and generation tasks. ALBERT is known for its efficiency and compact architecture, while GPT excels in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. By combining these two models, we aim to achieve improved performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- Datasets library by Hugging Face
